# Embryonic-mouse-spinal-Commissural-neuron-scRNA-sequencing


This repository contains R code, Seurat objects, and analysis outputs for single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of embryonic mouse spinal cord commissural neurons generated in the Jaworski Lab (Brown University).

The analysis focuses on integration across embryonic stages and downstream characterization of commissural neuron populations.
